# Am I Blacklisted dApp based on the dApp Starter template
> You can check the template [here](https://github.com/m1guelpf/dapp-starter)

This dApp is a very basic dApp I made to practice and learn. It just query the function "isBlacklisted" from the USDC contract in the Ethereum network. Anyone could do the same by checking it on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48#readProxyContract) but.. I just wanted to do it! ðŸš€
